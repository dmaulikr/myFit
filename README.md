myFit
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
myFit is an iOS application that allows users to keep track of their progress over thier fitness journey by allowing them to keep tack of their fitness stats. myFit will also provide a perfect place to store users current and previous workouts, diet plans, and fitness updates, so users can easily access these, or if they desire, look into the past to see how far they've truly come.

If you're like me and you were extremely over weight when you began your fitness journey, you probably wish you had taken pictures and kept track of your progress better than you did. That is what this app aims to do, as well as provide the user a repository for all of thier current and previous fitness needs.
